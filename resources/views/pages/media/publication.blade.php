        <p style="text-align:justify;" > “A Decade of Service to Humanity” is an illustration of the colorful journey of our beloved Yayasan 
            Wadah Titian Harapan/Wadah Foundation during the last 10 years. This photo essay is a celebration of 
            the works and services of the Wadah Foundation Founder, Mrs. Anie Hashim Djojohadikusumo, who has 
            dedicated her strength, energy, mind, passion, and love together with Wadah volunteers, staff and 
            executives during the last 10 years. <br> <br>

            This book also reminds us of her struggles and sacrifices for the people whom she loves and cares for 
            in serving the communities amidst all challenges and impacts during the growth process of the communities.
            May this book also remind us all of Ibu Anie’s favorite quote from Winston Churchill: “We make a living 
            by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.” In the end, we hope that this book would give 
            everyone a better understanding of Wadah’s services, done and conducted in all sincerity, humility, 
            commitment, and provide a positive impact to everyone who reads it. <br>

          <b>TROTOAR <br> THE LOST CHILDREN OF INDONESIA </b> </p>
        <p style="font-size:14px;"> Author: Tanis Chalopin <br>
          Publisher: Yayasan Wadah Titian Harapan (Aug 2010) <br>
          Product Dimensions: 21 x 28 cm <br>
          No. of Pages: 80 pages <br>

          Price: IDR 150,000 </p>

        <p style="text-align:justify;" > “TROTOAR” , the Lost Children of Indonesia” ia a photographic essay on 
          how children slip through the cracks of our society and vanish from our view because of mind-numbing 
          poverty, and our own tragic and selfish inattention. This book is a small step towards understanding 
          and reaching out. Let’s make sure together that it will become the first solid stone of a contribution 
          towards the rehabilitation of these children. <br> <br>

          In Indonesian Trotoar (‘Trottoir” in French) means ‘sidewalk’. Born to poor to pay for official 
          registration, many children in large cities of Indonesia are without identity cards. <br> <br>

          “In photographing their secret struggle, living off sidewalks, railroads, garbage dumps, flooded 
          riversides, performing in the street, begging or selling themselves, I wanted to show their courage 
          of surviving, each and every day in face of adversity and suffering, yet with that unmistakable 
          sparkle of hope in their eyes.  I feel privileged to have been invited to photograph these children 
          for the first book of Wadah Foundation. I hope that this book will serve as a tool to spread a 
          message of love and generosity towards all the children in the world”.
