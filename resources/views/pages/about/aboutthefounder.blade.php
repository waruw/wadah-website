            Mrs Anie Harjati Djojohadikusumo 
            is the founder and President of Wadah Titian Harapan Foundation, an Indonesia -based international 
            foundation established by women for women and their families.
            <br> <br>
            WADAH from the onset is an acronym derived from Wanita dan Harapan or Women and Hope; Titian Harapan, “a Bridge of Hope”.  
            As the organization, its scope, its experiences and scale grew, it soon became clear that WADAH was driven by a much greater, 
            much wider force and more meaningful purpose – that is, the people in the communities that it embrace and serve.  
            Thus, WADAH now stands for Warga dengan Harapan or “People in the communities with Hope”.
            <br> <br>
            Wadah Foundation grew out of a need to bring hope to people by helping them help themselves and share a better future for their 
            families and their community.  Wadah was founded in 2008 to specifically address the special needs of women as they participate in social, 
            educational, community and cultural activities.
            <br> <br>
            WADAH stands by its vision “Empowerment, education, economic self-sufficiency for all.” To achieve aforesaid vision it is guided by its mission, 
            “To enable impact leaders- men and women – to bring hope, care, change to their communities to achieve millennium development goals.”
            <br> <br>
            Operating at impoverished and underprivileged levels in the society, WADAH supports Indonesian women and their children by offering the 
            opportunity to manage their lives beyond family survival, lifting them out of the spiral of illiteracy and poverty. 
            To date, Wadah has and continuously supports thousands of underprivileged children from communities directly being assisted by Wadah as well 
            as partner organizations within and outside of Indonesia i.e., the Philippines, Nepal, India and Africa.
            <br> <br>
            In 2016, through the leadership of Mrs. Djojohadikusumo, Wadah Foundation has been given a Special Consultative Status at the UN Economic 
            and Social Council (ECOSOC).
